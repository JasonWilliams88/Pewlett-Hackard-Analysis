### Major take aways

- Only 2 managers were in the list of titles.
- The low amount of assistant engineers leads me to believe that upperward mobility is good at PH.
-


## Summary

- The disparity of managers might be from the way titles are handles at PH. A senior engineer might also manage a team. talking with the company to get a breakdown of sub titles will need to occur.

-

### Additional queries

- A search with older and younger time points to find a better list of managers
- A list of new employees can be generated and paired with the mentors
